Reinforcement Learning Agent for Connect 4
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent capable of playing Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect 4. The agent will start by making random moves and improve its decision-making through trial and error by receiving rewards and penalties for actions. The project will demonstrate the core RL concepts, including Markov Decision Process (MDP), value functions, and Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for training the agent.

Objectives
Develop a Reinforcement Learning agent capable of playing Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect 4 from scratch.


Train the agent using a reward system to guide its decision-making process.


Optimize the agent's performance over time, starting with random moves and progressively improving.


Create a web or terminal-based interface where the agent plays against itself or a human player.


Document the entire process and provide insights into model performance, reward structure, and training techniques.



Key Features
Game Environment:


Choose between Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect 4.


The agent will interact with the environment through state representations (e.g., board configurations).


Reinforcement Learning Algorithm:


Implement Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to optimize the agent’s strategy.


Define a reward function based on game outcomes: win = +1, loss = -1, and draw = 0.


Training Process:


The agent will train through trial-and-error over numerous game iterations.


Exploration vs. exploitation: The agent will balance exploring new moves and exploiting known strategies.


Performance Monitoring:


Track and visualize the agent’s improvement over time using metrics such as win rate, reward accumulation, and action selections.


User Interface (Optional):


Provide an option to play the game against the agent, either via command-line interface (CLI) or a web interface.


Logging & Documentation:


Record a demo showing the agent's learning progression.


Publish a GitHub repository with code, documentation, and training results.



Technologies to Use
Programming Language: Python


Libraries/Frameworks:


TensorFlow or PyTorch (for deep reinforcement learning and DQN model)


OpenAI Gym (for implementing the Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect 4 environment)


NumPy (for numerical operations and handling game state data)


Matplotlib (for visualizing training results and agent performance)


Tools:


Jupyter Notebooks or PyCharm for interactive development and debugging.


GitHub for code repository and version control.


Optional:


Flask/Django (for web interface development if choosing a web-based interface)



Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Environment Setup
Choose the game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect 4) and implement it using OpenAI Gym or a custom environment.


Define the game’s state space (possible board configurations) and action space (available moves).


2. Define the Reward System
Define the reward function:


Win: +1


Loss: -1


Draw: 0


This reward system will guide the agent's learning process.


3. Implement the RL Algorithm
Q-learning:


Implement the Q-learning algorithm, where the agent will learn an optimal policy through state-action value estimation.


The agent will update its Q-values based on the reward feedback.


DQN (Optional for deeper learning):


Implement a neural network to approximate the Q-values if using DQN.


This is useful for more complex environments like Connect 4 where the state space is larger.


4. Training the Agent
Train the agent by allowing it to play against itself or a random opponent.


Use epsilon-greedy strategy for exploration vs. exploitation: Initially, the agent explores more, and over time, it exploits the learned strategy.


Track the agent’s performance over training episodes and fine-tune hyperparameters like learning rate, epsilon decay, and reward function.


5. Testing & Evaluation
Evaluate the agent's performance after training, using metrics like win rate and game-play time.


Test the agent against human players (optional) to validate its learning and strategy effectiveness.


6. User Interface (Optional)
Create a command-line interface (CLI) where users can play against the agent.


Optionally, develop a web-based interface using Flask or Django for a more interactive experience.


7. Documentation & Demo
Record a video demo showing the agent’s improvement over time (e.g., showing initial random moves vs. strategic gameplay).


Document the project on GitHub, including setup instructions, code, and training results.



Optional Extensions
Test Different RL Algorithms: Implement PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) or A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) for more advanced RL techniques.


Play Against Human Players: Allow the agent to play against human players via a simple CLI or web interface.


Transfer Learning: After training on Tic-Tac-Toe, transfer the learned model to Connect 4 (using a similar reward system) and test if the agent adapts to the new game.
